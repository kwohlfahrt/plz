# plz ðŸ˜¸

*Say the magic word.*

`plz` is a job runner targetted at training machine learning models as cheaply as possible. At the moment is optimised for pytorch, in the sense that you can run pytorch programs without preparing a pytorch environment. With proper configuration and preparation it is fairly general, and can be used for practically anything that requires running a job in a repeatable fashion on a dedicated cloud VM.

`plz run` performs a number of operations. Some of them are the operations you always do when running things in the cloud or an experimenting environment. It just automates those for you. It also keeps history in a structure fashion and allows to rerun jobs.

1. Starts a "worker" (typically on AWS EC2, but also locally) to run your job.
2. Packages your code, parameters and data and ships them to the worker.
3. Runs your code.
4. Saves the results (like losses) and outcomes (like models) so that you can back to them in the future.
5. Takes down the worker.
6. Reruns previous jobs as to make sure the results are repeatable.
7. Provides a history including the result and parameters, so that you have experiment data in a structured format. 


## Future work

In the future, `plz` is intended to:

* add support for visualisations, like tensorboard,
* manage epochs to capture intermediate metrics and results, and terminate runs early,
* and whatever else sounds like fun. ([Please, tell us!](https://github.com/prodo-ai/plz/issues))

## Installing dependencies

1. Run `pip install pipenv` to install [`pipenv`](https://docs.pipenv.org/).
2. Run `make environment` to create the virtual environments and install the dependencies.

For more information, take a look at [the `pipenv` documentation](https://docs.pipenv.org/).

## Using the CLI

See the CLI's [*README.rst*](https://github.com/prodo-ai/plz/blob/master/cli/README.rst).

## Deploying a test environment

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install [direnv](https://direnv.net/).
3. Create a *.envrc* file in the root of this repository:
   ```
   export SERCRETS_DIR="${PWD}/secrets"
   ```
4. Create a configuration file named *secrets/config.json* based on *example.config.json*.
5. Run `make deploy`.

## Deploying a production environment

Do just as above, but put your secrets directory somewhere else (for example, another repository, this one private).
